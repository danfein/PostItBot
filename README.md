Servo driven post-it note window display

This project is an effort to have a post-it display of the weather on my window without having to manually update the arrangment. 

I am going to run two seven-segment style digits using 14 servos (28 post-its) as a start.

The servos will be driven by an Arduino Uno (r3) connected to an Adafruit 16 channel controller

The data will come from the Weather Underground API via the Arduino Ethernet Shield (r3).
